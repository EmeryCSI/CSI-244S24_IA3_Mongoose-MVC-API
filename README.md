## Independent Activity 3 - Vehicle API

You have been asked to build a Web API which connects to MongoDB and returns data regarding Vehicles.
The Vehicle data should have the following fields:

- Make
- Model
- Year
- Color
- Price

Use mongoose and the MVC design pattern to create a RESTful API that can perform the following operations:

- Create a new Vehicle
- Retrieve all Vehicles
- Retrieve a single Vehicle by ID
- Update a Vehicle by ID

Test the API using Postman or a similar tool to ensure that it works as expected. Take a screenshot of the output for each operation and include it in your submission.

You will be graded on the following Criteria:
